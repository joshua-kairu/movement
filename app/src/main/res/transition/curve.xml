    <!-- Use arc motion to handle curved path movement -->

    <!--

    minimumHorizontalAngle -  minimum arc angle in degrees between start and end points when they are close to horizontal
    minimumVerticalAngle - minimum arc angle in degrees between start and end points when they are close to vertical.

    PathMotion - class to move views in a curve
    implement PathMotion then use in transition XML as follows
          <changeBounds>
            <pathMotion class="my.app.transition.MyPathMotion"/>
          </changeBounds>

    PatternPathMotion - PathMotion that takes a Path pattern and applies it to the separation between two points.
        The starting point of the Path will be moved to the origin and
        the end point will be scaled and rotated so that it matches with the target end point.
        use in transition XML
         <changeBounds>
            <patternPathMotion android:patternPathData="M0 0 L0 100 L100 100"/>
         </changeBounds>
